# Code of Conduct for a Project

**Question: How, and in what specific ways, does the code of conduct for a project support diversity, equity, and inclusion?**

## Overview

Code of Conduct for a Project measures whether a project has a code of conduct, how clearly it defines acceptable behavior, the accessibility and consistency of its enforcement mechanisms. Key data points include the existence of the code of conduct, clarity of behavioral guidelines, enforcement procedures, and transparency in reporting violations.
A code of conduct in a project provides: a way to evaluate a community for diverse, equitable, and inclusive design before investing any time in that project, information about whether or not a person’s demographic is protected before participating in a project, reassurance that project partners and allies also take diversity, equity, and inclusion seriously and also understanding how a violation is reported and handled, a way of knowing that the code of conduct is being enforced; and not just the potential for enforcement, clear expectations of community behavior and information about possible avenues of support to victims of inappropriate behavior. A well-implemented code of conduct reduces conflicts, protects contributors, and creates a safe space for diverse participation, which is essential for a project's long-term success.

### Data Collection Strategies

*Qualitative*

*   Identify the location of the code of conduct as it pertains to primary areas of interaction and participation in the projects (i.e., repository root, project website, communication channels).
*   Determine if the code of conduct passes [Mozilla’s Code of Conduct Assessment Tool](https://mozilla.github.io/diversity-coc-review.io/)
*   Interview community members to understand more about why the code of conduct does or does not meet their expectations.
*   Interview community members as to what the project can do to improve the code of conduct?
*   Interview community members regarding how this community met or exceeded code of conduct expectations

*Quantitative*

*   Survey participants about the code of conduct. Sample survey questions include:
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: How well did the project meet your code of conduct expectations?
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: How clear are you on the rights and responsibilities of community members as described in the code of conduct?
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: How much does  a code of conduct influence your participation and sense of safety?
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: How easily did you understand the code of conduct and how to report violations?
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: How easily did you locate the code of conduct and how to report violations? \[i]
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: To what extent did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to
        fully participate in this project? \[i]
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, to what extent was it resolved to your satisfaction? \[i]
