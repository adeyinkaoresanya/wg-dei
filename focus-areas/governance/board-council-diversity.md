# Board/Council Diversity

**Question:** What is the diversity within a governing board or council?

## Overview

A governing board (or council - hereafter governing board) is a group of individuals who steer an open source project. This metric evaluates the diversity within a governing board, which is the group that guides an open source project. Diversity can be represented in various forms, including racial diversity, ability, age, neurodiversity, geographical diversity, and others. A diverse governing board also increases the chance that the issues raised by members of diverse backgrounds are heard and understood. By measuring this metric, communities can assess the inclusivity of leadership and ensure that a wide range of perspectives are represented. Understanding board diversity can also highlight the presence of intersectionality, encouraging leaders to consider the complex identities of their members, and promoting health and sustainability in the project by fostering inclusivity at all leadership levels.
