# Sponsorship

**Question: How effective are long-time members who sponsor people in supporting diversity and inclusion in a community?**

## Overview

Sponsorship measures the number of projects or community member who receive support—where a sponsor within or outside the community uses their reputation to create opportunities for sponsored people to advance. Data points include the number of active sponsorships, the progress of sponsored people (e.g., role advancement), and the diversity of sponsored individuals. Sponsorship helps retain members, grow contributors, and foster leadership development.
Sponsorship ensures newer or less active members gain visibility and opportunities, strengthens community bonds, and reduces turnover. Sponsored people are 90 percent less likely to perceive bias in a community [(1)](https://fortune.com/2017/07/13/implicit-bias-perception-costs-companies/). Sponsorship also ensures diverse voices are promoted, ultimately creating a more inclusive and equitable community culture.

### Data Collection Strategies

*   Interview members:
    Conduct interviews with new and existing members for feedback concerning the project’s sponsorship process. Potential questions might be:

    *   For protégés: In what ways has the sponsorship program helped you become more successful?
    *   In what ways has the sponsorship program improved diversity and inclusion within the project?
    *   In what ways could the sponsorship program be improved?
    *   Did the sponsorship program help you gain more responsibility and/or more leadership within the project?
    *   Capture information about potential diverse proteges in events/meetups
        *   Have you sponsored someone who identifies as a different gender than you?
        *   Exchange gender with any dimension of interest from the Dimensions of Demographics.

*   Survey members:

    *   Survey members: “Does your community have a sponsorship program and, if so, do you have a process by which people can apply?”
    *   Survey protégés: “Who are you hoping to sponsor?”
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: I am sponsoring other members.
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: I am sponsoring members who are different from me.
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: I have a sponsor within the community who puts their reputation on the line to advocate for me.
    *   Likert scale \[1-x] item: Has sponsorship helped community members advance in their project roles?
