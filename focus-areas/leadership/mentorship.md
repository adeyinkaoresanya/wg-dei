# Mentorship

**Question:** How effective are our mentorship programs at supporting diversity and inclusion in our project?

## Overview

Mentorship programs are integral in welcoming new contributors and supporting the growth of existing members. This metric assesses how mentorship programs contribute to diversity and inclusion by examining participation, retention, and the advancement of mentees, with a focus on underrepresented groups. An effective mentorship program not only supports community sustainability but also attracts diverse contributors, encouraging them to take on greater roles over time.

### Data Collection Strategies

Project leaders and mentors can gather data through the following methods:

*   **Interviews with Mentors and Mentees**
    *   Discuss formal and informal mentorship experiences within the community.

*   **Observational Tracking**
    *   Track mentee contributions during and after mentorship to understand trajectory and retention.
    *   Record notable mentee achievements, such as becoming subject matter experts or taking on increased responsibilities.

*   **Program Assessment**
    *   Measure diversity and participation rates in mentorship programs (e.g., number of mentors, mentor experience levels, and types of projects).
    *   Compare mentee retention rates with the overall community average.

*   **Surveys**
    *   Use Likert-scale questions for mentorship feedback, such as:
        *   "I have found the mentoring experience personally rewarding."
        *   "I would recommend mentoring in this community."
    *   Collect mentor insights on training, community support, and mentorship communication channels.

*   **Demographic Data Collection**
    *   Record mentee demographics, including geographic location, to analyze inclusivity.

### Filters

Filter the mentorship metric by types of mentorship programs (e.g., Google Summer of Code, Outreachy) and mentor experience levels.
