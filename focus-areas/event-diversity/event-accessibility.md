# Event Accessibility

**Question:** To what extent does your event accommodate those with various accessibility needs?

## Overview
This metric evaluates the accessibility accommodations provided by event organizers for attendees with diverse needs. Data points include physical and virtual accessibility features, such as wheelchair access, captioning, sign language interpreters, and low-bandwidth options. Measuring this metric promotes inclusivity and ensures that events are accessible, enhancing both the health and sustainability of the community by fostering a welcoming environment for all participants. Accessibility is also crucial for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), enabling equal participation opportunities for people with disabilities.

### Data Collection Strategies

There are several different ways to signal attention to  this metric which may include:
- **Event Registration Form:** Include questions about accessibility needs.
- **Event Support/Accessibility Request Form:** Provide a way for attendees to request specific accommodations.
- **Event Web Page:** Ensure accessibility features and resources are clearly listed.
- **Survey Attendees and Speakers:** Assess satisfaction with accessibility accommodations using Likert scale questions (e.g., “The event met my accessibility needs”).

Depending on the size of the event as well as the financial constraints and implementations may include:

- Accessibility audit of the event website (e.g. colorblind-friendly contrasts, screen-reader support, etc.)
- Remote access via live stream
- Captioning in live stream and in-person settings 
- Sign language interpreters
- Sighted guides at the event
- Wheelchair access
- Quiet room for meditation, prayer, or rest
- Ensure your registration system allows for dietary needs (multiple if possible)
- Provide accessible washrooms
- Provide amenities / feminine hygiene products in washrooms
- Website and on-site event signage that is color-blind friendly 
- Providing a speaker guide with relevant accessibility guidance (for example, ensuring their slides are color-blind friendly)
- Providing agendas and other important conference documents in Braille language
- Asking about any accessibility needs prior to the event during conference registration
- Providing information on the website with regard to the number of stairs or steps to and from the main entrance, conference rooms, and restrooms
- Access to the slides and presentations before, during, and after the conference is over
- Low-bandwidth platform considerations
- Gender-neutral restrooms
- Room design (photo rows, strollers)
- [Family Friendliness](https://chaoss.community/metric-family-friendliness/)
- Using visual cues (e.g. floor stickers, spacers, etc.) to facilitate social distancing in densely populated places or queues, e.g. ticketing, food, etc.

Event organizers should have a comprehensive list of the initiatives they’ve implemented, and should make that list available on their website for attendees and speakers.
