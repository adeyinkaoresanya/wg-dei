# Family Friendliness

**Question:** How does enabling families to attend together support diversity and inclusion of the event?

## Overview

Family Friendliness measures the availability and quality of family-friendly amenities at events, such as childcare, activities for children, and event tracks designed for youths and families. Data points include the provision of childcare services, youth-specific programming, and communication about these options to caregivers. This metric helps in lowering barriers to participation for parents, guardians, and caregivers, thereby broadening the potential attendee base. Offering family-oriented amenities can increase overall attendance. Family Friendliness highlights how well an event supports attendees with caregiving responsibilities, promotes inclusivity by accommodating diverse life situations and making events accessible to those who might struggle to attend due to family obligations, ensuring that family-friendly options are well-communicated and available helps create a more equitable space for all participants.
