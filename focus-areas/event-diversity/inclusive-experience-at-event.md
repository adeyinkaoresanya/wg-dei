# Inclusive Experience at Event

**Question: To what extent does an event organizing team commit to an inclusive experience at an event?**

## Overview

Inclusive experience at event  measures how included and welcome attendees feel at an event based on their personal experiences.  Inclusiveness of an event is most impactful when attendees feel included and welcome. Data points include attendee feedback on inclusivity, their sense of belonging, and how effectively the event’s inclusive efforts are perceived. It assesses whether organizers’ efforts to create a welcoming environment are successful, if the event encourages diverse participation, and promotes attendee satisfaction, which leads to higher engagement and retention for future events. It highlights gaps between organizers’ intentions and attendees' actual experiences, ensuring that inclusion is not just a goal but a reality. Focusing on attendee perceptions, this metric helps event organizers build a truly welcoming space that meets the needs of all participants.

### Data Collection Strategies

Survey attendees about perceptions of inclusivity:

Survey with Likert Scale \[1-5] (Or Emoji Scale):

*   I feel included at the event
*   I feel uniquely valued by the event staff
*   I had chances for my voice to be heard in sessions
*   I plan to come back to this event

Interview attendees and speakers:

*   Have you experienced anything during the event that made you feel unwelcome or unincluded?
*   Did you observe something that could make someone else feel unwelcome and unincluded?
*   Could you provide specific examples to help event organizers mitigate this in the future?
*   What is something that organizers of this event could improve on in the future regarding inclusivity at the event?
