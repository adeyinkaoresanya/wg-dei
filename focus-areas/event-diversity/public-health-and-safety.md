# Public Health and Safety

**Question: To what extent does your event address public health through policies around masks, vaccines, COVID testing, and in infrastructure such as ventilation and air purification in indoor venues?**

## Overview

Public Health and Safety measures the public health and safety policies for in-person events. Events have always come with the risk of contagious diseases, and that risk has been brought into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic. This risk is shared by everyone at and around an event, and is particularly exclusive of people with disabilities, chronic illness, caregivers, people who are otherwise at high risk, and those who live with them. Addressing that risk is a multi-layered problem that is highly context dependent. To help, there exist bodies of work, such as the [Public Health Pledge](https://publichealthpledge.com/), which can be used to navigate this important issue. It is not possible to completely eliminate risk, and even event organizers who do their best will find themselves with additional measures they wanted to take but couldn’t. Even with limitations, an event organizer should do their very best to implement a robust multi-layered approach to public health, and provide information about the measures they’ve taken so that prospective participants have an opportunity to make themselves aware of areas of potential risk, and to assess for themselves how they handle that risk.

### Data Collection Strategies

There are several different ways event organizers provide information about their public health policies and we can collect data from there:

*   [Public Health Pledge event assessments page](https://github.com/phpledge/badging)
*   Event registration form
*   Event speaker proposal flow
*   Event Health and Safety / COVID-19 / Public Health / On-site Safety page
*   Event web page

### Filter

Here are ways to look at data for public health policies :

*   Proof of vaccinations for all event attendees, staff, volunteers, speakers, and exhibitors
*   Masking policies
*   Testing
*   Venue’s sanitizing and cleaning policies
*   Indoor air quality
*   Alternative modes of participation
*   Monitoring or surveying attendees daily for signs of illness
*   Global locations of events
