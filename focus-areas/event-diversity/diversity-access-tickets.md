# Diversity Access Tickets

**Question: How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?**

## Overview

Diversity Access Tickets measures the effectiveness of diversity access tickets in promoting inclusivity at events and tracks the number, demographics, and event participation of economically disadvantaged or underrepresented individuals who receive discounted or free tickets. Data points include the number of tickets offered, the demographics of recipients, and the contribution of these attendees to event diversity. It increases attendee diversity, and helps sustain future event growth by building a more inclusive community. Diversity access tickets are a critical tool for reducing economic difficulties and encouraging participation from underrepresented groups. This metric assesses how well an event supports equitable access, tracks outreach effectiveness, and ensures that diverse voices are included, thereby strengthening the event’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.  Diversity Access Tickets is applicable to virtual, in-person, or hybrid events.
