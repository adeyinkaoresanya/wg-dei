# Event Location Inclusivity

**Question**: Is the event located in a region where governments, cultural contexts, or society may cause harm to the physical safety and/or psychological safety of event attendees?

## Overview

This metric assesses the inclusivity and safety of an event location for all attendees, particularly those from marginalized groups. It measures factors like local legislation, societal attitudes, and nearby concurrent events that could impact the physical or psychological safety of attendees. By evaluating these aspects, this metric helps organizers choose inclusive locations, communicate potential risks, and make informed decisions that align with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) values. Event organizers, sponsors, and attendees can use this metric to ensure that safety concerns are transparently addressed, ultimately supporting a more welcoming environment for all participants.

### Data Collection Strategies

Event organizers can answer the following about their event and share this information with potential event attendees and sponsors:

1.  Has the event's region or geographic location been placed on a list of places of concern for any of the following demographics?
    *   Sexual and gender minorities
    *   People with disabilities
    *   Racial and ethnic minorities
    *   Women
    *   Religious minorities

2.  Are there any other events happening in the same location at the same time as your event that could potentially bring harm to a subset of any attendees?

3.  In what ways does the event communications address or acknowledge any cause for concern for marginalized attendees?

4.  What are the financial costs associated with attending the event?

5.  How geographically accessible is the event location?

6.  Are there religious holidays and observations occurring at the same time as the event?

7.  What are the visa-related issues with traveling to the event?

8.  Are there known air quality concerns at the event location?

9.  What are the public transport options at the event location?

10. Does the venue have documented labor disputes?

11. What is the demographic diversity at the event location?

12. What accessibility accommodations does the event provide?

Event organizers can include a post-conference question asking attendees about event location inclusivity.
