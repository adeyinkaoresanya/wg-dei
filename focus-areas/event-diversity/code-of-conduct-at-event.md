# Code of Conduct at Event

**Question:** How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?

## Overview
This metric measures the visibility, accessibility, and effectiveness of a Code of Conduct at an event. It identifies whether participants can access the Code of Conduct easily, understand reporting procedures, and feel safe attending the event. An event with a code of conduct sends the signal that the organizers are willing to respond to incidences, which helps people from all backgrounds feel respected, included and comfortable attending the event. This metric aids in understanding the proactive measures in place to protect attendees and encourage a welcoming environment. Effective Codes of Conduct can improve community health by reinforcing behavioral expectations and providing clear responses to incidents.

### Data Collection Strategies 

**Observe whether a code of conduct is posted at an event:*
- As an attendee or event staff, observe whether participants will have an easy time finding a code of conduct posted at the event. Having a code of conduct prominently posted at a registration site may be useful.
- Observe that code of conduct has a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event.

**Observe event website:**
- Observe that code of conduct on the website has a clear avenue for reporting violations via email.
- Observe that code of conduct/event website provides information about possible ways to provide support victims of inappropriate behaviour, eventually links to external bodies?
- Browse the event website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations at the event, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be easily discoverable)

**Interview and/or survey participants to understand more about why the event code of conduct did or did not meet their expectations:**
- What can this event do to improve the code of conduct at this event?
- What are some examples of how this event met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?
- Are participants required to accept the code of conduct before completing registration?

**Survey participants about the code of conduct:**
  * Likert scale [1-x] item: How well did the event meet your code of conduct expectations.
  * On registration, and during the event were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate at this event? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]
