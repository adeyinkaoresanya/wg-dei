# Event Demographics

Question: To what extent does an event consider and pay attention to attendee, speaker, and volunteer demographics?

## Overview

Event Demographics measures the [demographics](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) diversity of attendees, speakers, and volunteers at an event. Key data points include the representation of various demographics (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) within each group and how these groups feel about their inclusion. This metric is applicable to virtual, in-person, and hybrid events. A diverse range of viewpoints fosters richer discussions and innovation, leading to more engaging and inclusive events. It reveals how well an event promotes [diversity](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics), equity, inclusion and allow event organizers to address gaps if any and improve retention for future events. It also highlight imbalances in speaker or volunteer representation, ensuring that decision-making panels and content reflect a wide variety of experiences.

### Data Collection Strategies

Note that demographic information is sensitive information and if you are using this metric, you should pay particular attention to the (CHAOSS Data Use Statement)\[https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/data-use-statement.md]. Several options exist to collect demographic information. These options include:

*   Request attendee and speaker [demographics](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/) during conference registration with an option to opt-out of providing information.
*   Use a survey before, during, or after an event to gather attendee and speaker demographics. (For example, using the [Open Demographics questions](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/))
*   For virtual events: If a virtual event platform supports real-time polling, use polls to better understand the audience and background of people who attend your event.

### Filters

*   Demographics: Responses to subjective questions should be analyzed to gather diverse perspectives. Investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether some demographics feel less included than the average.
*   Keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
*   Diversity throughout the conference that is not restricted to a single track or series.
*   Attendees
*   Speakers
*   Volunteers
*   Conference Committee
