# Project Access

Question: To what extent does your project provide access and help those with various access needs?

## Overview

Project Access: measures how accessible different parts of the project are for community members and new contributors. Data points consist of an assessment of potential barriers to access, such as technology, governance, resources, internet access, or inattention to accessibility concerns. Open source projects should be accessible to all. Community members and maintainers want their projects to be as accessible as possible for all with an interest in contributing. By documenting and cataloging measures to improve access taken by the project team, community members can be empowered to contribute to a project and take on leadership roles more easily and transparently. Considerations for access may include physical ability, neurodiversity, a contributor’s location, their native language, available internet bandwidth, or other potential barriers to participating in an open source project.

Depending on the size of the project, the key considerations for project accessibility, includes code and documentation access, platform compatibility, adherence to accessibility standards, global-friendly meeting formats, diverse communication methods, support for non-code contributions, global mentorship programs, regional chapters, and translation support.
