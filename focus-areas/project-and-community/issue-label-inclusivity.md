# Issue Label Inclusivity

**Question:** How well are project issues labelled to invite new contributors, skilled contributors, non-code contributors, and other types of contributors?

## Overview

Issue Label Inclusivity measures the accessibility and inclusiveness of project issues for contributors of various skill levels and backgrounds. Data points include the number and types of labels used, the clarity of issue titles and descriptions, and the presence of labels that indicate the level of skills needed to tackle the issue. The Issue Label Inclusivity metric can help a project ensure: newcomer friendly issues are created, issue list diversity, usable titles and descriptions, and consistent use of labels to identify types of contributor or skill level needed to work on an issue. Inclusive labelling practices help create a more equitable and accessible environment for contributors from all backgrounds. Providing clear and informative labels, helps  projects reduce the learning curve for new contributors, encourage participation and promote diversity within the community.
