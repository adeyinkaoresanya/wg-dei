# Issue Label Inclusivity

**Question: How well are project issues labelled to invite new contributors, skilled contributors, non-code contributors, and other types of contributors?**


## Overview
Issue Label Inclusivity measures the accessibility and inclusiveness of project issues for contributors of various skill levels and backgrounds. Data points include the number and types of labels used, the clarity of issue titles and descriptions, and the presence of labels that indicate the level of skills needed to tackle the issue. The Issue Label Inclusivity metric can help a project ensure: newcomer friendliness issues are created, mentor availability, issue list diversity, usable titles and descriptions and consistent use of labels to identify types of contributor or skill level needed to work on an issue.
Inclusive labelling practices help to create a more equitable and accessible environment for contributors from all backgrounds. Providing clear and informative labels, helps  projects reduce the learning curve for new contributors, encourage participation and promote diversity within the community.

### Data Collection Strategies

- Identify the published list of issue labels used for each project
   - *General labels*:
      - Presence of labels to identify general needs of  “Feature”, “Bug”, and “Documentation” label”, a “Front End”, and a “Back End” label in the project’s list of labels and in the issue list (labels in use)
   - *Inclusive labels*:
     - Newcomer friendly ones look for (*newcomer*, *good first issue*) in the project’s list of labels and in the issue list (labels in use)
     - Mentor friendly ones look for (*mentor*) in the project’s list of labels and in the issue list (labels in use)

  - *Skill labels*:
     - Presence of labels to identify skills needed (e.g, Java, Python, HTML, machine learning) in the project’s list of labels and in the issue list (labels in use)

- Observe the frequency of each label used across issues in a project
