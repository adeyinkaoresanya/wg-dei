# Project Demographics

**Question:** What are the demographics within a project?

## Overview

Project Demographics measures the diversity and representation within a project.  It identify potential areas of improvement for inclusivity based on demographic data. Project demographics help indicate the potential for different viewpoints and broader perspectives and representation in the context of a project community. Because of diverse perspectives, investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether people from various demographics feel more or less included than the average.
Project demographics also help determine the [diversity](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) of project members, retaintion of community members from diverse backgrounds within the project, determine if community members are diverse when grouped by [board membership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/governance/board-council-diversity.md), maintainers, conference organizers, and contributors, ensure non-sensitive community demographic information are shared with others, ensure a statement of privacy management of demographic information are created, discover less-visible stories with regard to intersectionality of the demographic data and identify potential areas of improvement for inclusivity based on demographic data.
