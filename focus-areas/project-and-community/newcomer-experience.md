# Newcomer Experience

**Question:** How well does an open source community attend to welcoming newcomers?

## Overview

This metric evaluates how effectively an open source community creates a welcoming environment for new members. It encompasses aspects of onboarding, orientation, and ongoing support, allowing projects to measure and understand their approach to newcomer experience.

By analyzing the newcomer experience, projects can:

*   Identify strengths and weaknesses in their welcoming processes
*   Foster a more inclusive and engaging community for all members.
*   Assess how community design enhances the newcomer experience.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of documentation in aiding new contributors.
*   Recognize and support new community members.
*   Identify available resources for newcomers.
*   Highlight areas for improvement in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues affecting newcomers.

### Data Collection Strategies

#### Quantitative

*   Track subsequent contributions from first-time contributors to assess engagement.
*   Monitor [New Contributors Closing Issues](https://chaoss.community/?p=3615) to evaluate new contributor activity.

#### Qualitative

*   Conduct surveys that include newcomer experience questions, such as:
    *   Likert scale items (1-x):
        *   I feel welcome in the community.
        *   I feel like I am making a contribution to the community.
        *   I am satisfied with the current community structure.
        *   I would like to help more in the community.
        *   I have the ability to have an impact in the community.
        *   The community treats new members well.
    *   Open-ended questions, such as:
        *   What does the community lack that you wish it didn’t (e.g., more in-person events, DEI research)?
        *   What obstacles did you encounter when starting with the community (e.g., difficulty finding information, meeting times)?
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of:
    *   Mentorship programs aimed at newcomers.
    *   Newcomer onboarding training.
    *   Peer-to-peer mentorship within the community.
    *   Project Documentation via related metrics:
        *   [Documentation Discoverability](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-discoverability/)
        *   [Documentation Accessibility](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-accessibility/)
        *   [Documentation Usability](https://chaoss.community/metric-documentation-usability/)
