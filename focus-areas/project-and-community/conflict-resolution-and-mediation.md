# Conflict Resolution and Mediation

**Question:** How do open source maintainers address conflict that may arise while collaborating on a project?

## Overview:

Conflict Resolution and Mediation measures how effectively open-source projects address and resolve disagreements among contributors. Data points include the frequency and nature of conflicts, the methods used for resolution (e.g., discussion, mediation, voting), and the time taken to resolve disputes. Effective conflict resolution create’s a positive and productive environment, preventing escalation and maintaining contributor engagement. This metric helps leaders like community managers, OSPO managers, project maintainers etc. to  navigate disagreements constructively. Community managers can use this metric to assess conflict resolution effectiveness for a healthy community. OSPO managers uses it to inform conflict resolution policies. Event organizers also use it to identify positive conflict resolution practices at events. Project maintainers can use it to learn how to maintain positive relationships and healthy collaboration within the community.
Inclusive conflict resolution processes ensure that all voices are heard and that disputes are resolved fairly, regardless of contributors' backgrounds. This creates a more welcoming and equitable environment, encouraging diverse participation and promoting a sense of belonging within the community.

### Data Collection Strategies

Identification of Conflicts:

*   Are details about the conflict resolution and mediation process included in the project governance (or linked from the governance documentation?
*   Does the project offer any conflict resolution training to maintainers or leaders in the community?
*   Do community members know how conflicts are resolved?
*   Is there a documented process for mediation when community members disagree?
*   Are there different conflict resolution policies for technical disagreements and personal disagreements?
*   Is there a way to indicate when “conversations” turn into “conflict?”
*   Is the mediation party a neutral third party? How is neutrality defined?
*   Is there a medium in which community members can report incidents where conflicts arise?
*   What are the materials presented to analyse the origin of these conflicts?

Example survey questions to gauge people’s satisfaction with and knowledge of the process:

*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: I feel that there are conflicts in the community that go unresolved.
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: I feel that conflicts within the community have a negative impact for other community members.
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: If I had a conflict within the community, I know where to turn to find resolution.
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: There are specific areas within the community where conflict continually arises.
*   Likert scale \[1-x] item: Conflicts in my community become personal.
