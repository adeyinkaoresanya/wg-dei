## Background

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to the health of open source communities. The CHAOSS Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Working Group aims to define metrics and methods to help others measure and center diversity, equity, and inclusion in their own Open Source projects. The CHAOSS DEI Working Group establishes and broadly communicates an ethical, peer-validated, research-informed, set of standards and best practices for measuring diversity, equity, and inclusion in Open Source projects. We invite anyone interested in the topic of diversity, equity, and inclusion to learn more, and join us. See [Contributing](#contributing) below to become part of our community.
