**N.B:** _This section is for project owners, admins, organisers, or maintainers to complete. The outreach ambassador will walk them through these steps._

### Step 1: Self-Assessment and Documentation
- Review your project’s DEI practices using the four CHAOSS DEI metrics: Project Access, Inclusive Leadership, Communication Transparency, and Newcomer Experience.  
- [link each of these metrics to their further details]  
- Document your reflections and current practices in a file named `DEI.md`, placed in the root of your project’s repository for community feedback. Refer to the DEI.md guide and DEI.md template for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Apply for a Badge
Once your `DEI.md` file is live and public, a project owner can submit an application for a badge at the project badging website. Note that the repository containing the `DEI.md` file must be specified in the application.

### Step 3: Evaluation
The badging bot automatically scans your repository to check that your `DEI.md` addresses the four CHAOSS DEI metrics and follows the template. If the review is successful, your project qualifies for a badge.

### Step 4: Recognition
Successful projects receive the **bronze badge**, which is the first level badge. This can be displayed on your website, documentation, or anywhere you showcase your project’s values.

### Step 5: Continued Engagement
We encourage projects to re-apply (about once a year) to keep their badge current.  
In the future, additional badge levels (Silver, Gold, Platinum) will be available, including new CHAOSS metrics.
